title: "Do Math Whizzes Save More? Long-term Effect of Mathemathical Education on Consumption Behavior"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/math-education-paper
excerpt: 'Whether our formative experiences, including education, leave long lasting impacts on our later life consumption habits is an emerging question that has received more and more attention in recent literature. In this paper, I present how mathematical education during formative period of high school can shape later life consumption and spending
habits. Exploiting the variation in required math courses triggered by “A Nation At Risk” report in the 1980s, combined with rich retail panel data, I show that additional math
coursework can lead to roughly 20% improvement on coupon utilization rate, and this effect persists until much later in life. Evidence also suggests that the effect is strongest amongst minority consumers.'
