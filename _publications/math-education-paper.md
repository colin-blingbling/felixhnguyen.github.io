title: "Long-Term Effect of Mathematical Literacy on Consumer Behavior: Evidence from Curricular Reforms"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/math-education-paper
excerpt: 'Whether our formative experiences, including education, leave long lasting impacts
on our later life consumption habits is an emerging question that has received more
and more attention in recent literature. In this paper, I examine how mathematical
education during formative period of high school can shape later life consumption
and spending habits. Exploiting the variation in required math courses for high school
graduation from a series of curricular reforms in the late 1980s, I show that increase in
mathematical literacy can lead to significant increases in consumption-related saving
behavior, up to 15.4% reduction in monthly packaged goods expenditure and increase
coupon usage rate by nearly a quarter. These effects persist to much later in life, and
are robust to potential biases from staggered adoption. Further analyses also show
that the effects vary across demographic groups, are stronger for minorities, and differ
between before and after the financial crisis of 2008.'
